# Introduction <br />
This document describes the credit approval process at the Coop Group and how it is digitized.<br />

Coop dedicates a certain amount of money for each project running currently and in the future. Therefore, project managers and their teams have a fund to finance their projects with. This fund is regulated by the project manager him-/herself and the responsible line managers. Depending on how much money the team is requesting for a task, there are certain approval procedures that must be adhered to.<br />

The team "Lemons" will simplify and digitalize the current process for Coop and build a prototype within Camunda and Make.<br />

# Process Design <br />
In the following chapter the process design of the as-is-process and the to-be-process will be described. The to-be-process was defined in meetings with Coop. <br />

## As-Is-Process <br />
In the as-is-process the person submitting the credit application was filling out a word form which must be printed out and later on sent to different participants depending on the project and actual amount of the credit which was asked for. <br />

Since the process is paper-based and not digital, the document must be sent to the respective approvers via in-house mail.<br />

The course of the process is based on the project managers and the management levels to be involved, depending on the amount requested. The approval process always has 3 approvers, the first two of which are determined from the data of the selected project. The sub-project manager and the project manager are always involved.<br />
In reality, there is often a deviation from the predefined process flow, which leads to competence regulations not being respected. As a result, problems with the internal audit team can arise at a later stage. <br />

A clear disadvantage of the current process is, that it is not transparent at what stage of approval the process currently is. <br />

## To-be-Process <br />
As mentioned above the to-be-process was defined in meetings with Coop. Withing the meetings it became clear, that the process itself should not be changed. The actual requirement is that the process should be digitized and become audit compliant. <br />

Therefore, the process flow will stay the same and as mentioned above: <br />

Credit applicant – sub-project manager – project manager – line manager<br />
